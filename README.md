## Application Layout  

The interface is divided into two main sections:  
1. **Telemetry and Operational Data**:  
   Displays key mission parameters like voltage, current, and packet counts.  

2. **Graphical Visualizations**:  
   - Altitude vs. Time  
   - Acceleration vs. Time  
   - Temperature vs. Time  
   - Rotation vs. Time  

Each graph features:  
  - Square design for symmetry and focus  
  - Neon-colored plot lines (1.5px thickness)  
  - Real-time data updates for seamless analysis
